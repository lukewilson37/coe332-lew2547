# COE 332 HOMEWORK 07: Flow Chart Design

For this homework, a flowchart detailing the api call method for my COE332 midterm project [Where Is ISS](https://github.com/lukewilson37/where-is-ISS). The midterm details a flask aplication which accessed via curl call. Each curl call takes a url which is read by the application. An example curl command is below:

```shell
$ curl localhost:5037/United_Kingdom/Wales/cities
```
The Flow Cart located in ```apiFlowChart.png  ``` shows how the api reads the url and what it returns based upon each url possibility. 

## API Flow Chart

This chart was generated with [draw.io](draw.io)
