# COE 332 HOMEWORK 07: Flow Chart Design

For this homework, a flowchart detailing the api call method for my COE332 midterm project [Where Is ISS](https://github.com/lukewilson37/where-is-ISS). The midterm details a flask aplication which accessed via curl call. Each curl call takes a url which is read by the application. An example curl command is below:
```shell
$ curl localhost:5037/United_Kingdom/Wales/cities
```
