For the first assignment in COE 332, we create two python scripts from the command line; something I am not previously familiar with. I used the terminal editor vim to create these scripts. 
To do this, I had to ``` install``` python3, as well as ```pip install`` math to use
## Contents

### print-primes.py

this script finds and prints all primes between 3 and 100

### three-lists.py

this script generates an intitial list with integers from 1 - 10. it then creates a list with the first 10 squares and finally creates a third list with the first 10 cubes.
